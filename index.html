<h1>Who are you?</h1>

<p>My name is Jomark Cagatin. I am currently studying at the University of Bohol, taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. My hobbies include watching anime, horror movies, and K-dramas. I am kind and helpful to everyone, but when it comes to studying in this course, I am full of doubt. To conquer this, I will do my very best to achieve my goals.</p><br/>
<p style="color: blue;">WHAT IS YOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE IN LIVING YOUR LIFE AND WHY IS THAT SO?</p><br/>
<p>Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinion drown your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, as they already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p><br/>
<p style="color: blue;">HOW ARE YOU ALIKE AND DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS?</p><br/>
<p>The similarity between me and others is that we are kind to each other, even though we are not related by blood. We understand and help each other. The difference between me and them is that I am somewhat childish and shy. I don't usually initiate conversations; I am quiet and wait for others to talk to me.</p><br/>
<p style="color: blue;">ENUMERATE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS, HOWEVER SMALL OR UNIMPORTANT THEY MAY SEEM, WHICH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE PROUD OF?</p><br/>
<p>Being a good person, even though I am shy, I actively help others when they are in difficult situations. This kind of accomplishment may not be appreciated by everyone, but in the bottom of my heart, it's a significant achievement for me.</p><br/>
<p style="color: blue;">WHAT ARE YOUR DREAMS AND FUTURE PLANS?</p><br/>
<p>I have several dreams and future plans:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Obtain a stable job</li>
  <li>Start a business</li>
  <li>Invest</li>
  <li>Build a house</li>
  <li>Buy a car</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
  <li>Lastly, start a family</li>
</ul>
